Therefore, similar accounting is required in this and other <span class="s29">FN36 </span>transactions where a principal stockholder pays an expense for the company, unless the stockholder’s action is caused by a relationship or obligation completely unrelated to his position as a stockholder or such action clearly does not benefit the company.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">FN36 For example, SAB Topic 1.B indicates that the separate financial statements of a subsidiary should reflect any costs of its operations which are incurred by the parent on its behalf. Additionally, the staff notes that AICPA Technical Practice Aids <u>§</u> <u>4160</u><s>4160</s> also indicates that the payment by principal stockholders of a company’s debt should be accounted for as a capital contribution.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some registrants and their accountants have taken the position that since FASB ASC Topic 850, Related Party Disclosures, applies to these transactions and requires only the disclosure of material related party transactions, the staff should not analogize to the accounting called for by FASB ASC paragraph 718-10-15-4 for transactions other than those specifically covered by it. The staff notes, however, that FASB ASC Topic 850 does not address the measurement of related party transactions and that, as a result, such transactions are generally recorded at the amounts indicated by their terms. <span class="s29">FN37 </span>However, the staff believes that transactions of the type described above differ from the typical related party transactions.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">FN37 However, in some circumstances it is necessary to reflect, either in the historical financial statements or a pro forma presentation (depending on the circumstances), related party transactions at amounts other than those indicated by their terms. Two such circumstances are addressed in Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 1.B.1, Questions 3 and 4. Another example is where the terms of a material contract with a related party are expected to change upon the completion of an offering (<u><i>i.e.,</i></u><s>i. e.,</s> the principal shareholder requires payment for services which had previously been contributed by the shareholder to the company).</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The transactions for which FASB ASC Topic 850 requires disclosure generally are those in which a company receives goods or services directly from, or provides goods or services directly to, a related party, and the form and terms of such transactions may be structured to produce either a direct or indirect benefit to the related party. The participation of a related party in such a transaction negates the presumption that transactions reflected in the financial statements have been consummated at arm’s length. Disclosure is therefore required to compensate for the fact that, due to the related party’s involvement, the terms of the transaction may produce an accounting measurement for which a more faithful measurement may not be determinable.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, transactions of the type discussed in the facts given do not have such problems of measurement and appear to be transacted to provide a benefit to the stockholder through the enhancement or maintenance of the value of the stockholder’s investment. The staff believes that the substance of such transactions is the payment of an expense of the company through contributions by the stockholder. Therefore, the staff believes it would be inappropriate to account for such transactions according to the form of the transaction.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li></ul></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Amend paragraph 718-10-S99-1, with no link to a transition paragraph, as follows:</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 195%;text-align: left;">Compensation—Stock Compensation—Overall SEC Materials</h1><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">General</p><ul id="l4"><li data-list-text="&gt;"><h3 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: -7pt;text-align: left;">SEC Staff Guidance</h3></li></ul><ul id="l5"><li data-list-text="•"><h3 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: -5pt;text-align: left;">&gt; Staff Accounting Bulletins</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="•"><h3 style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: -5pt;text-align: left;">• &gt; SAB Topic 14, Share-Based Payment</h3><h3 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">718-10-S99-1 <span class="p">The following is the text of SAB Topic 14, Share-Based Payment.</span></h3><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The interpretations in this SAB express views of the staff regarding the interaction  between  FASB  ASC  Topic  718,  Compensation—Stock Compensation, and certain SEC rules and regulations and provide the staff’s views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies.

Thus, throughout this SAB the use of the terms “reasonable” and “reasonably” is not meant to imply a single conclusion or methodology, but to encompass the full range of potential conduct, conclusions or methodologies upon which an issuer may reasonably base its valuation decisions. Different conduct, conclusions or methodologies by different issuers in a given situation does not of itself raise an inference that any of those issuers is acting unreasonably.

If the award is not fully vested at the grant date, compensation cost is recognized and additional paid-in-capital is increased over time as services are rendered over the requisite service period. A similar pattern of recognition should be used to reflect the amount presented as temporary equity for share-based payment awards that have redemption features that are outside the <u>issuer’s</u><s>issuers</s> control but are classified as equity instruments under FASB ASC Topic 718. The staff believes Company F should present as temporary equity at each balance sheet date an amount that is based on the redemption amount of the instrument, but takes into account the proportion of consideration received in the form of employee services. Thus, for example, if a nonvested share that qualifies for equity classification under FASB ASC Topic 718 is redeemable at fair value more than six months after vesting, and that nonvested share is 75% vested at the balance sheet date, an amount equal to 75% of the fair value of the share should be presented as temporary equity at that date.
